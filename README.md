## Introduction

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

An API to view your champions, add new champions, and get your stats for each champ - all in one database and 100% open source. 
This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis
